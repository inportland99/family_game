# there should be a bonus of diffrent values only to be added by adults
# kids can create activities but they have to be approved by adults

----------
Add students model and student authentication with devise
	parents need to see students
	DONE students need to see activities and rewards (index only)

Parents should be able to sign up and create their student accounts

add categories to activities & rewards

Send nightly email with summary of activities

prevent users from seeing other people's pages via url
	# Devise handles authentication which lets you into the app
	# You still need authorization to handle what users can and can't see / edit

----------
DONE Add logged in username to menubar and dropdown to edit your profile
DONE # user authentification
DONE archive activities and rewards instead of deleting them (this removes them from views, but keeps the points earned or spent)
	Add active column to each model
	edit _form, index views to handle active = true
DONE make description fields smaller in simple_form_for (activities, rewards)
	  <%= f.input :description, :input_html => { :rows => 3 } %>
DONE allow login by username
	# https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Allow-users-to-sign-in-using-their-username-or-email-address
DONE remove archived activities from the add points form
	# used collection and passed an instance variable with just active activities
DONE sort leaderboard by columns (add earned in last week column)
	# railscasts #228 sortable table columns
DONE menu uses username instead of name. Edit profile should allow edit of other fields

		XXX remove xp, xp_used, credits, rank from Users
		XXX add student_id to Users model
